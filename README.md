### In order to make the tasks more organized and accessible, I have created separate folders for each task. To run a task, simply download the corresponding folder and open the included Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb).

### To ensure that you have all the necessary information to complete each task accurately and efficiently, I have also included a "read me" file within each folder.

### Please note that in order to run the project smoothly, there are some additional requirements that must be installed beforehand. Kindly ensure that these requirements are installed on your system prior to attempting to run the project.
