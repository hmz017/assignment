The ImageStatisticsCalculator class has four public properties: Mean, StandardDeviation, MinValue, and MaxValue. These will be set by the CalculateStatistics method.
The CalculateStatistics method takes a string parameter called imagePath that specifies the path to the image file. It opens the file as a binary file and creates a BinaryReader object to read the binary data.
The method reads the image header, which contains information about the image dimensions, bytes per pixel, and stride. It then verifies that the image is an 8-bit grayscale image.
The method reads the pixel data into a byte array.
The method calculates the mean gray value by summing all the pixel values and dividing by the number of pixels.
The method calculates the variance of the pixel values, and then the standard deviation from the variance.
The method finds the minimum and maximum gray values by iterating through the pixel data.
Note that there is some commented-out code in the CalculateStatistics method that checks whether the image is an 8-bit grayscale image.
 This code is not used in the current implementation it will be useful if you need to add more specific image type checks in the future.

To use this code, we must create an instance of the ImageStatisticsCalculator class and call its CalculateStatistics method with the path to the image file as a parameter. The calculated statistics would then be available through the class properties. 
I already create it, save it in pro.cs and you can use it for any image you want just replace the image path with yours
