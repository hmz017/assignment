### important 

After exploring various options, including using ML.NET and OpenCVSharp, I unfortunately wasn't able to successfully implement the solution in C#. However, I was able to successfully develop a working solution using Python and TensorFlow.

I understand that this may not be the preferred approach, but I wanted to ensure that the task could move forward and meet its objectives. If you have any concerns or questions about this approach, please let me know. I am open to any feedback and suggestions you may have.

Thank you for your understanding and support throughout this. I look forward to learn more about ML.NET .
